# Time-Series-Research-Project:
The goal of project is to help local farmers in making better decisions based on weather data.
The project is a Research Project and all the analysis and forecasting is done on live data.
The project mainly focuses on determining average air temperature, average humidity, average wind speed and a threshold value of soil temperature that would help farmers to get an idea of when to water the farm.
Various approaches such as considering different features to determine target variable, considering only history of variable and statistics models are used to solve the above problem statement.
The project mainly works on two methods namely Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU) and Statistical Models such as AR, Exponential Smoothing.
